# e70.github.io

This is my [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) user page. It supports and enforces [https](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/).

GitHub user pages require a repository named `<user>.github.io`, here `e70.github.io` and a GitHub user page is [always](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) served from the master branch at [https://e70.github.io/](https://e70.github.io/).
Markdown content including `README.md`, that is automatically handled as an index page is pushlished with a basic stylesheet.

This is used as for `eniederacher.com` apex and `www.eniederacher.com` hosting via Cloudflare.
