# e70.github.io

This is my [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) user page. It supports and enforces [https](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/).

GitHub user pages require a repository named `<user>.github.io`, here `e70.github.io` and a GitHub user page is [always](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) served from the master branch at [https://e70.github.io/](https://e70.github.io/).
Markdown content including `README.md`, that is automatically handled as an index page is pushlished with a basic stylesheet.

This is used as for `eniederacher.com` apex and `www.eniederacher.com` hosting via Cloudflare.

## setup https



## Setup custom domain

1. Add a CNAME in your DNS zone, for `eniederacher.com` see
https://dash.cloudflare.com/f1cf607e32aedc064d3064a9925bd089/eniederacher.com/dns
2. Add that custom domain to your repository, see <https://github.com/e70/e70.github.io/settings>

## Setup Jekyll

GitHub pages supports [Jekyll themes](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/).

From the [supported](https://pages.github.com/themes/) themes only the very basic [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) or [minimal](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) themes look promising.

But we go better with static landing pages
