# e70.github.io

This is my GitHub pages user page.

GitHub user pages require a repository named `<user>.github.io`. So I created this repository named `e70.github.io`. A GibHub user page is [always](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) served from the master branch.

It is served at [https://e70.github.io/](https://e70.github.io/) and Markdown including `README.md`, which automatically acts as an index page is pushlished. GitHub pages supports [Jekyll themes](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/).
